USB allows 100mA without enumerating.

Only significant thing on 3v3 is the STM32F0 which pulls 22mA at full whack, or
under 5mA if clocked at 8MHz from LSI without PLL.

Displays will be run off the 5V rail with MOSFETs on the common anodes feeding
5V.  Cathodes will run to GPIOs which can sink up to 25mA each, or 80mA total.
So each segment can be set for 10mA consumption.
